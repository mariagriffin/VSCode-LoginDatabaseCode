# VSCode-LoginDatabaseCode

Login in Application, using Java code, connecting to a database (I used MySQL Workbench Localhost 3306)
This is a workspace that is working in VS Code.

**IMPORTANT** Download the **WHOLE** **Demo** **folder**! (Not just the Java File)
Update the code with **YOUR** database details.

**DATABASE** use the mysecureapplication.sql script to create your database or create your own
